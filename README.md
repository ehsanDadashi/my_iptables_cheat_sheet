# my_iptables_cheat_sheet
it is a cheat sheet for me to review my iptables learning
# the old name of iptables was ipchain 
# iptables has 4 table 
each table defines a feature for iptables service

the default table for iptables service is filter.

filter : you can act like firewall service

mangle : you can limit QOS (quality Of Service)

NAT :

RAW :
# each rule in iptables named as chain
your chain can create rule on input , forward or output
